# Vienna SET/SDET Tracker

A daily-scraped job board for Vienna SDET/QA positions, served as a static single-page app with an interactive map.

## What it does

A GitHub Actions pipeline scrapes Vienna QA/SDET listings daily from karriere.at, kununu, and JobSpy (LinkedIn, Indeed, Google Jobs), geocodes office addresses, and writes `jobs.json`. The frontend groups jobs by company, shows them as filterable cards or clustered map pins, and adds a rough salary estimate based on the job title seniority level.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Konoszaf1/vienna-set-tracker.git
cd vienna-set-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run tests with `npm test` (unit) and `npm run e2e` (Playwright against a production build).

## Job validator

`scripts/jobValidator.mjs` runs a three-stage title filter on every scraped listing:

1. **Domain exclusion** — hard-rejects pharma, electrical, customer service, payroll, food safety, and manufacturing "quality" roles that share keywords but aren't software testing positions.
2. **Role-type whitelist** — title must positively match an SDET/QA engineer pattern (`test automation engineer`, `qa engineer`, `software test`, `testingenieur`, etc.). Generic titles like "QA Specialist" or "Test Coordinator" are dropped.
3. **Management filter** — rejects `Head of`, `Testmanager`, `Projektmanager`, `Coordinator`, etc. unless the title also contains a hands-on signal (`engineer`, `developer`, `architect`). Controlled by the `REJECT_MANAGEMENT` flag at the top of the file (default: `true`).

The same filter logic is ported to `scripts/discoverJobs.py` for JobSpy discoveries.

## Company ratings

`scripts/fetchCompanyRatings.mjs` runs after the job scraper in CI and queries kununu.com for each company's overall score. Results are cached in `public/company-ratings.json` with a 14-day TTL.

Glassdoor ratings can't be scraped from CI (Cloudflare). Instead, `public/company-ratings-manual.json` is a user-maintained overlay file — add entries like `{ "Company Name": { "glassdoor": 3.8 } }` and they'll merge into the ratings cache on the next pipeline run.

## Testing

The project has a comprehensive test suite spanning unit, integration, and end-to-end layers. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for full details.

```bash
npm test              # unit + integration (vitest, ~6s)
npm run test:coverage # unit + coverage report
npm run e2e           # Playwright across 5 browser targets
```

**Unit tests** (182 tests, 14 files) cover utilities, components, script-layer logic, and a JSON schema contract test. All tests use deterministic fixtures via MSW — no live network calls.

**E2E tests** (26 specs x 5 browsers = 130 tests) run against a production build with fixture data, covering filters, settings persistence, network error recovery, external link safety, accessibility (axe-core), and keyboard navigation.

**Coverage thresholds** are enforced in CI: >=80% for `src/utils/`, >=80% statements / >=60% branches for `src/components/` (MapView excluded — covered by e2e + extracted helpers).
